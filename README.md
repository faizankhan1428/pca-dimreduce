# ML Exercise 9 - PCA DimReduce

This notebook applies **Principal Component Analysis (PCA)** to compress high-dimensional digit data into two principal components.

### 🔍 What’s Inside:
- Preprocessing and scaling
- Applying PCA
- Visualizing 2D PCA space

### 🎯 Learning Goal:
- Understand the concept of PCA
- Visualize how PCA separates digit classes
- Measure explained variance

### 🚀 Extensions:
- Try with different `n_components`
- Combine PCA with clustering/classification
- Compare with other dimensionality reduction methods (e.g., t-SNE, UMAP)
